# ACML_lab1
Implementing Backpropagation

# Instructions

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Google Colaboratory service/ Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy 1.18.5
- Matplotlib 3.2.2
- PyTorch 1.7.0 and Keras 2.4.3
- Kornia 0.4.1 and Scikit-image 0.17.2


## How to launch the code?

- Firstly, you should open the corresponding notebook in [Google Colaboratory service](https://colab.research.google.com/) or locally on your computer with [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install.html).

- In the notebook the code is arranged in a sequential way. In order to reproduce the corresponding results, you need to open a notebook in Google colab (preferably using GPU runtime) and run each cell of the code sequentially, then wait for the result to run.

- The following training parameters are available for modification: the number of epochs ("NUM EPOCHS"), the learning rate ("learning rate"), weight decay ("weight decay"), the criterion ("criterion") and the optimizer("optimizer").
